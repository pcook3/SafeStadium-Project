Kennesaw State University requires an effective method of communication to enhance gameday operations 
by facilitating interactions between event coordinators. The current communication platforms are disorganized 
and lack real-time accessibility, leading to operational delays and poor coordination. SafeStadium integrates various 
features, such as real-time notifications, emergency assistance, and an interactive digital timeline, to promote seamless interaction 
between the different parties involved in gameday planning. This allows SafeStadium to enhance stadium security, promote effective communication, 
and elevate the experience of game-day planning for all parties involved.
