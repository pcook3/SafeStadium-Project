Kennesaw State University requires an effective method of communication to enhance gameday operations 
by facilitating interactions between event coordinators. The current communication platforms are disorganized 
and lack real-time accessibility, leading to operational delays and poor coordination. SafeStadium integrates various 
features, such as real-time notifications, emergency assistance, and an interactive digital timeline, to promote seamless interaction 
between the different parties involved in gameday planning. This allows SafeStadium to enhance stadium security, promote effective communication, 
and elevate the experience of game-day planning for all parties involved. 

The SafeStadium website is crafted to deliver vital information and tools concerning stadium safety and operations. At the top of the page, thereâ€™s a navigation bar that allows users to easily access various sections of the site. This navigation bar includes links to the Home, My Shifts, Announcements, and Report pages, making it simple for users to find the information they need and complete necessary tasks.

The Home page is the main entry page, providing live updates and interactive information. It clearly displays the date and time, and they update automatically so that visitors receive the information at their command. The page also has a temperature counter that provides an approximated or a random temperature value. Another feature unique to this page is that Monday content on it is never reproduced elsewhere but viewed on a particular Monday alone. This is helpful in terms of sharing critical week-end messages, promotions, or important notice in the workings of the stadiums.

The My Shifts page provides users with a calendar of shifts that have been assigned to them. This component helps employees or staff keep tabs on their work responsibilities and organize themselves. Through the provision of one place where shifts can be managed, the section enables users to organize their work schedule accordingly without any disorganization.

The Announcements page is the key component for important updates and announcements regarding stadium events, policy, or safety protocol. The users can view this section to keep themselves updated with any important changes or updates. This page is particularly useful in helping all employees or interested persons to get information regarding stadium operation in a timely fashion.

The Report page aims at facilitating easy reporting of issues relating to security, maintenance, or other concerns within the stadium. The feature allows users to log and report occurrences in a helpful way, in that any issue is resolved expeditiously by the concerned personnel. By providing a structured system of reporting, this section enhances stadium safety and operational efficiency.
