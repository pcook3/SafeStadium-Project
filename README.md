Kennesaw State University requires an effective method of communication to enhance gameday operations 
by facilitating interactions between fans, athletes, event coordinators, and vendors. The current communication 
platforms are disorganized and lack real-time accessibility, leading to operational delays and poor coordination. 
SafeStadium integrates various features, such as real-time notifications, emergency assistance, and AI-driven analytics, 
to promote seamless interaction between the different parties involved in gameday planning. This allows SafeStadium to 
enhance stadium security, promote effective communication, and elevate the experience of game-day planning for all parties involved.
